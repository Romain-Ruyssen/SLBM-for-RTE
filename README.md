# SLBM-for-RTE
This code is a MATLAB implementation of a Staggered Lattice Boltzmann Method (SLBM) for the approximation of solutions of the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE), proposed in the article: https://hal.science/hal-04101825
  
The solution of three problems is given:
1. the free stream of a laser beam,
1. the stream of a pulse in an absorbing and isotropically scattering medium,
1. the stream of a gaussian pulse in an anisotropically and inhomogeneous medium.

The full description of the three problems can be found in the same article.

The solution of the first problem can be obtained simply by running the file "main_Laser_problem.m", the second one running "main_Pulse_problem.m" and the third one running "main_HetAni_problem.m".
